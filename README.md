# bikeshare
## Introduction
This is part of Udacity Python foundation course that uses knowledge of Python's modules- Pandas and Numpy, to make sense of the bike sharing data provided, and answer relevant questions about it.

## How to use
This repository contains-
1. Three csv files with data for three cities- <i>chicago.csv</i>, <i>new_york_city.csv</i>, <i>washington.csv</i>.
2. One python file written to assess the data in the csv files- <i>bikeshare.py</i>.

To use the project-
1. Place the <i>bikeshare.py</i> file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
2. Run the python file using a suitable python interpreter.

## Resources
